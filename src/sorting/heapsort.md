## Heap Sort

Consider a PQ with n items implemented by means of a heap.
	The space used is O(N).
- methods `insert` and `removeMin` takes O(logN) time. 
- methods `size` `isEmpty` `min` take O(1) time.
- using a heap-based PQ we can sort a sequence of n elements in O(NlogN) time
- Heap sort is much faster than insertion and selection sort.
